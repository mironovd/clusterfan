Cluster algebras fan calculations

Calculates fans of cluster algebras (see works of G. Koshevoy, B. Keller, B. Leclerc).

At this point this is prrof of concept.

Calculates number of cones in fan of cluster algebra for n=5 (the answer is 672).

TODO:
- Create presentation for association graph&
- Calculation for n=6,finding limit of imaginary elements.
